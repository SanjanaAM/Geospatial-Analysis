ðŸ“Œ Title
Navigating Disasters: Exploring the Role of Geospatial Analysis in Disaster Management

ðŸ“– About the Project
This project focuses on how geospatial analysis and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) can help manage natural disasters like floods, wildfires, hurricanes, and volcanic eruptions. By using satellite images, spatial data, and smart algorithms, we can better understand where disasters happen, how bad they are, and how to respond quickly and effectively.

Different types of GIS tools â€” like Raster GIS, Vector GIS, 3D GIS, and Remote Sensing GIS â€” are used to visualize and analyze disaster-affected areas. These tools help emergency teams plan evacuations, assess damage, and make faster decisions during critical times.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives
* To explore how geospatial tools can improve disaster response.
* To study how GIS can help people prepare for and recover from disasters.
* To test different algorithms that detect and map disaster impacts.

ðŸ§  Algorithms Used
Change Detection
Compares before-and-after satellite images to quickly find changes caused by a disaster (like flooded areas or burned forests).

Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA)
Breaks down high-resolution images into parts like buildings or roads to identify specific damage (useful in cities or towns).

âœ… Conclusion
This project shows that geospatial tools can make a big difference in disaster management. Change detection gives a quick overview, while OBIA gives detailed insights. Together, they help save time, guide emergency response, and reduce disaster impact. In the future, adding real-time data from IoT devices and community reports can make these systems even smarter and more helpful.
